# Wapp (Wedding app...)

Fullstack website developed using the MERN stack, to aid my partner and I in managing our wedding and increase information flow between our guests.
The website is deployed and functional, running on a remote ubuntu server in orchestrated Docker containers. 
The idea is to allow guests to log in, view all information and record their food choices for the main meal. They can record their arrival time and see which room they are staying in etc.
All information is persisted to MongoDb and passed securely with encrypted jwts for security.
